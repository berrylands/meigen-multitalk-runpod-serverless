# S3 Deployment Status

## ✅ Completed Steps

1. **Docker Image Built and Pushed**
   - Image: `berrylands/multitalk-s3-quick:latest`
   - Build time: 7.1 seconds (using existing base image)
   - Pushed to DockerHub successfully
   - Contains S3 handler and updated main handler

2. **S3 Features Added**
   - ✅ S3 URL detection (s3:// and https://)
   - ✅ Download from S3 for inputs
   - ✅ Upload to S3 for outputs
   - ✅ Backward compatibility with base64
   - ✅ Error handling for "Incorrect padding" issue

## 🔄 Next Step: Update RunPod Endpoint

The S3-enabled image is ready. To complete deployment:

1. **Go to RunPod Console**
   - URL: https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless
   - Find endpoint ID: `kkx3cfy484jszl`

2. **Update Docker Image**
   - Click Edit/Settings
   - Change image to: `berrylands/multitalk-s3-quick:latest`
   - Save changes

3. **Verify S3 Environment Variables**
   Ensure these are set in RunPod:
   - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   - AWS_REGION
   - AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME
   - BUCKET_ENDPOINT_URL (if using custom endpoint)

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

Run the test script:
```bash
python test_s3_integration.py
```

Or test with your S3 audio file:
```bash
python test_s3_integration.py s3://your-bucket/audio.wav
```

## 📊 Expected Results

After updating the endpoint, you should see:
- Health check shows `"s3_available": true`
- S3 URLs are processed without base64 decoding errors
- Generated videos can be uploaded to S3
- Base64 inputs still work as before

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If S3 isn't working after update:
1. Check worker logs for import errors
2. Verify boto3 is installed: health check will show S3 status
3. Ensure AWS credentials are properly set in RunPod
4. Test with a simple S3 URL first

## 📝 Summary

The S3 integration is fully implemented and deployed to DockerHub. The only remaining step is updating the RunPod endpoint to use the new image `berrylands/multitalk-s3-quick:latest`.
