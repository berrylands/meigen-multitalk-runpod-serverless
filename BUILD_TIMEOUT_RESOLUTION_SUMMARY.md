# Build Timeout Resolution Summary

## What We Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Resolved Build Timeouts
- Created staged Dockerfiles (V123, V124) that build successfully
- Fixed timezone configuration issue that was causing builds to hang
- Used PyTorch 2.1.2 base image with CUDA 12.1
- Build times reduced and builds complete successfully

### 2. ✅ Fixed NumPy/SciPy Binary Incompatibility
- Pinned numpy==1.24.3 and scipy==1.10.1
- This resolved the "numpy.dtype size changed" error
- Properly layered dependency installation to catch issues early

### 3. ✅ Added Missing Dependencies
- Added easydict (was causing ModuleNotFoundError)
- Added all MeiGen-MultiTalk required dependencies:
  - omegaconf, tensorboardX, ftfy, timm
  - sentencepiece, peft, rotary-embedding-torch

### 4. ✅ Maintained Format Compatibility
- Handler accepts both V76 format (audio_s3_key/image_s3_key) and new format (audio_1/condition_image)
- Auto-converts between formats
- Fixed S3 handler signature compatibility

## Current Status

### Remaining Issue: HuggingFace Hub Compatibility
The latest error shows a version mismatch between diffusers and huggingface_hub:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'cached_download' from 'huggingface_hub'
```

This is because:
- diffusers 0.25.0 expects an older huggingface_hub API
- `cached_download` was deprecated in newer huggingface_hub versions

### Solution Options
1. Downgrade huggingface_hub to a compatible version (< 0.20.0)
2. Upgrade diffusers to a newer version that doesn't use cached_download
3. Use the working V76 base image dependencies

## Docker Images Created
- `berrylands/multitalk-runpod:v123` - Fixed NumPy/SciPy but missing easydict
- `berrylands/multitalk-runpod:v124` - Complete dependencies but huggingface_hub issue

## Key Learnings
1. Always set `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` and timezone to avoid interactive prompts
2. Use staged builds to isolate dependency issues
3. Layer Python dependency installation to catch conflicts early
4. Version pinning is crucial for ML dependencies
5. Test incrementally to identify specific dependency conflicts

## Next Steps
To fully resolve the issues:
1. Create V125 with compatible huggingface_hub version
2. Or investigate using the exact dependency versions from the working V76 image
3. Consider using the cog-MultiTalk dependency versions as reference
