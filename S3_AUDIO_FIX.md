# S3 Audio File Fix - v5 Update

## The Issue
From your logs, when you use "1.wav" as input:
1. The old handler tried to base64 decode "1.wav" 
2. This resulted in only 3 bytes of data
3. MultiTalk failed with "buffer size must be a multiple of element size"

## The Solution: `berrylands/multitalk-v5:s3-fix`

This version properly handles:
- **Simple filenames**: `"1.wav"` → Downloads from S3 default bucket
- **Full S3 URLs**: `"s3://bucket/key"` → Downloads from specified location  
- **Base64 data**: Long strings → Decodes as before

## Update RunPod
Change Docker image to: **`berrylands/multitalk-v5:s3-fix`**

## How It Works Now

When you provide `"audio": "1.wav"`:
1. Detects it's not base64 (too short, has .wav extension)
2. Constructs S3 URL: `s3://760572149-framepack/1.wav`
3. Downloads the actual WAV file from S3
4. Passes binary audio data to MultiTalk

## Test It
```python
# Should work with simple filename
job = endpoint.run({
    "action": "generate",
    "audio": "1.wav",  # Just the filename!
    "duration": 5.0,
    "output_format": "s3"
})
```

## Expected Result
- No more "3 bytes" error
- Real audio file downloaded from S3
- MultiTalk processes actual audio data
- Either real inference or proper fallback

## Important Notes
1. Your "1.wav" file must exist in the S3 bucket
2. The file must be a valid WAV audio file
3. S3 permissions must allow reading the file

The v5 update fixes the detection logic so simple filenames are treated as S3 keys, not base64!
