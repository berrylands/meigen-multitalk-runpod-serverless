# RunPod Update Guide - Fix "Test Implementation" Issue

## The Problem
Your RunPod endpoint is still running old code that shows "Test implementation" in the output. This is because RunPod is using a cached version of the container.

## The Solution: New Image `berrylands/multitalk-v3:2025-01-11`

This new image:
- ✅ Properly replaces handler.py with our complete implementation
- ✅ Includes real MultiTalk inference code
- ✅ Has unique version tags to force RunPod to update
- ✅ Removes all "Test implementation" messages

## Update Instructions

### Option 1: Update Existing Endpoint (Recommended)
1. Go to https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless
2. Click on endpoint `kkx3cfy484jszl`
3. Click "Edit Endpoint"
4. Change Docker Image to: `berrylands/multitalk-v3:2025-01-11`
5. Click "Update"
6. Wait for workers to restart (may take 2-3 minutes)

### Option 2: Force Refresh (If Option 1 doesn't work)
1. In the endpoint settings, click "Stop All Workers"
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Update image to: `berrylands/multitalk-v3:2025-01-11`
4. Click "Start Workers"

### Option 3: Create New Endpoint (Nuclear option)
1. Create a new serverless endpoint
2. Use image: `berrylands/multitalk-v3:2025-01-11`
3. Configure with same settings as before
4. Update your code to use the new endpoint ID

## Verify the Update

Run this script to verify the new handler is active:
```bash
python verify_handler.py
```

You should see:
- ✅ NEW HANDLER indicators
- Version: 3.0.0
- MultiTalk inference info present
- Processing note: "Real MultiTalk inference" or "Fallback test implementation"

## What Changed

### Old Handler (handler.py)
- Simple test handler
- Returns "Test implementation" message
- No real inference code

### New Handler (complete_multitalk_handler.py → handler.py)
- Complete implementation with real inference
- Includes MultiTalkInference integration
- Smart fallback if models unavailable
- Version 3.0.0

## Expected Output After Update

```json
{
  "video_info": {
    "processing_note": "Real MultiTalk inference",  // Not "Test implementation"!
    "models_used": ["wav2vec_model", "multitalk"],
    "audio_features_shape": [400, 768]
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "Test implementation"?
1. RunPod may be caching aggressively
2. Try using the dated tag: `berrylands/multitalk-v3:2025-01-11`
3. Check worker logs for any errors
4. Ensure workers have restarted

### Getting "Fallback" instead of "Real MultiTalk"?
This means:
- Handler is updated ✅
- But models aren't loading
- Check `/runpod-volume/models/` contains required models
- Check GPU memory availability

## Alternative Docker Tags

All these point to the same image:
- `berrylands/multitalk-v3:latest`
- `berrylands/multitalk-v3:2025-01-11`
- `berrylands/multitalk-v3@sha256:8158791f299cd409a3764154167af8930e6b0806a079511a761be7d114751073`

Use the dated tag or SHA256 to force RunPod to pull the new image.

## Success Metrics

You'll know it's working when:
1. No more "Test implementation" in output
2. Health check shows version 3.0.0
3. `multitalk_inference` field appears in responses
4. Real video generation (not test patterns) if models are available
