# Current Status - MeiGen MultiTalk RunPod Serverless

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done

1. **Project Structure Created**
   - Complete RunPod serverless implementation structure
   - Handler, Docker configs, test scripts
   - GitHub repository created

2. **Docker Image Fixed**
   - Initial image was built for ARM64 (Mac architecture)
   - Rebuilt and pushed AMD64 version: `berrylands/multitalk-test:latest`
   - Should now work on RunPod's x86_64 infrastructure

3. **Network Volume**
   - Volume ID: `pth5bf7dey` (100GB in US-NC-1)
   - Ready for model storage

## ‚ùå Current Issues

1. **GPU Configuration Mismatch**
   - Endpoint still configured for: `AMPERE_48,ADA_48_PRO` (48GB GPUs)
   - User wants: RTX 4090 (24GB)
   - This is why jobs were stuck in queue - no matching GPUs available

2. **Template Configuration**
   - Using template `x7tcaxtizz` which may have wrong settings
   - Need to update or bypass template

## üîß Immediate Actions Needed

### Option 1: Update via RunPod Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless
2. Click on "meigen-multitalk -fb" endpoint
3. Click "Edit" or settings icon
4. Change:
   - **GPU Type**: Select "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090"
   - **Idle Timeout**: 60 seconds (currently 5s)
   - **Workers Standby**: 0 (to save costs)
   - **Container Image**: Verify it's `berrylands/multitalk-test:latest`
5. Save changes

### Option 2: Create New Endpoint

If updating doesn't work, create a fresh endpoint without using a template.

## üìã Next Steps After GPU Fix

1. **Test Basic Handler**
   ```bash
   python test_simple.py
   ```

2. **Download Models** (once handler works)
   ```bash
   python scripts/download_models.py
   ```

3. **Deploy Full Implementation**
   - Build and push full MultiTalk Docker image
   - Update endpoint to use production image

## üöÄ Testing Commands

All test scripts are ready:
- `test_simple.py` - Basic health check
- `test_async.py` - Async job handling
- `test_endpoint_direct.py` - Direct API testing
- `check_endpoint_workers.py` - Worker status

## üí° Important Notes

- The AMD64 Docker image is now correctly pushed
- Jobs were cancelled to clear the queue
- Once GPU is fixed, endpoint should work immediately
- Models need to be downloaded to network volume before full functionality
