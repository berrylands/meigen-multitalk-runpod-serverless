## INTRO (0:00 - 0:45)

**[VISUAL: Animated logo reveal with energetic music]**

**Script:**
"What if I told you that you could run a powerful AI video generation model that normally requires expensive GPU servers, but only pay when you actually use it? No more burning money on idle servers!"

**[VISUAL: Show cost comparison graphic - Traditional GPU server ($500+/month) vs Serverless ($0 idle, ~$0.002 per video)]**

"Today, I'm going to show you exactly how to deploy MeiGen MultiTalk - an AI model that generates realistic talking videos from audio - on RunPod's serverless infrastructure. By the end of this video, you'll have your own API endpoint that can turn any audio into video, and it won't cost you a penny when you're not using it."

**[VISUAL: Demo of the final result - audio waveform transforming into a talking head video]**

"Let's dive in!"

---

## SECTION 1: Understanding the Problem (0:45 - 2:00)

**[VISUAL: Diagram showing traditional server architecture with GPU]**

**Script:**
"Traditional AI model deployment is expensive. You rent a GPU server, it runs 24/7, and you pay whether you use it or not. For hobbyists and small projects, this is a deal-breaker."

**[VISUAL: Show RunPod pricing page, highlighting serverless option]**

"RunPod Serverless changes this. You only pay for the seconds your model is actually processing. Let me show you what we're building today."

**[VISUAL: Architecture diagram showing:
- Client sends audio
- RunPod spins up container
- Model processes
- Returns video
- Container shuts down]**

"Here's our architecture: when you send audio, RunPod automatically starts a container, runs the model, returns your video, and shuts down. You only pay for those few seconds of processing."

---

## SECTION 2: Prerequisites and Setup (2:00 - 4:00)

**[VISUAL: Checklist appearing on screen]**

**Script:**
"Before we start, you'll need a few things:"

**[VISUAL: Navigate to runpod.io]**

"First, create a RunPod account. You'll need to add at least $10 in credits to get started."

**[VISUAL: Show RunPod dashboard, highlighting the API keys section]**

"Once logged in, go to Settings and create an API key. Save this somewhere safe - we'll need it later."

**[VISUAL: Show DockerHub website]**

"You'll also need a DockerHub account to store your container images. It's free to create."

**[VISUAL: Terminal showing Python version check]**

"Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher and Docker installed on your machine."

```bash
python --version
docker --version
```

---

## SECTION 3: Understanding the Model (4:00 - 5:30)

**[VISUAL: MeiGen MultiTalk GitHub repository]**

**Script:**
"MeiGen MultiTalk is an AI model that generates realistic talking head videos from audio input. The challenge? It needs about 80GB of model files and requires a powerful GPU."

**[VISUAL: Show file sizes of different models]**

"Here's what we're dealing with:
- MeiGen-MultiTalk model: 9.3 GB
- Wan2.1 model: 68.9 GB  
- Supporting models: ~4 GB
- Total: ~82 GB"

**[VISUAL: Diagram showing network volume concept]**

"We'll store these models on RunPod's network volume - think of it as a persistent hard drive that our serverless containers can access."

---

## SECTION 4: Creating the Network Volume (5:30 - 7:00)

**[VISUAL: RunPod dashboard - Storage section]**

**Script:**
"Let's create our network volume. In the RunPod dashboard, go to Storage."

**[VISUAL: Click "New Network Volume" button]**

"Click 'New Network Volume'. Name it 'multitalk-models' and set the size to 100GB. This gives us room for our 82GB of models plus some breathing space."

**[VISUAL: Show region selection]**

"Important: Select the same region where you'll run your serverless workers. This ensures fast model loading."

**[VISUAL: Volume created successfully]**

"Great! Now we have persistent storage for our models."

---

## SECTION 5: Writing the Handler Code (7:00 - 10:00)

**[VISUAL: VS Code or code editor open]**

**Script:**
"Now for the fun part - writing our handler. Create a new file called `handler.py`."

**[VISUAL: Type out the basic structure]**

```python
import runpod
import os
import base64
import time

def handler(job):
    """RunPod handler function"""
    job_input = job.get('input', {})
    
    # Health check
    if job_input.get('health_check'):
        return {
            "status": "healthy",
            "timestamp": time.time()
        }
```

**Script:**
"Every RunPod handler needs this basic structure. The `handler` function receives jobs and returns results."

**[VISUAL: Add model loading code]**

```python
# Global model cache
model = None

def load_models():
    global model
    if model is None:
        model_path = '/runpod-volume/models'
        # Load your models here
        print(f"Loading models from {model_path}")
    return model
```

**Script:**
"We cache models globally to avoid reloading on every request. This significantly improves performance."

**[VISUAL: Add video generation logic]**

```python
    # Generate video
    if job_input.get('action') == 'generate':
        audio_b64 = job_input.get('audio')
        audio_data = base64.b64decode(audio_b64)
        
        # Process with model
        model = load_models()
        video = generate_video(audio_data)
        
        return {
            "success": True,
            "video": base64.b64encode(video).decode()
        }
```

**Script:**
"The main logic: decode the audio, process it through the model, and return the video as base64."

---

## SECTION 6: Creating the Dockerfile (10:00 - 12:00)

**[VISUAL: Create new Dockerfile]**

**Script:**
"Now we need to containerize our handler. Create a `Dockerfile`:"

**[VISUAL: Type out Dockerfile]**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    ffmpeg \
    git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

**Script:**
"We start with Python 3.10 and install FFmpeg for video processing."

**[VISUAL: Add Python dependencies]**

```dockerfile
# Install Python packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir \
    runpod \
    torch \
    transformers \
    numpy \
    Pillow
```

**Script:**
"These are our core dependencies. RunPod for the serverless framework, PyTorch for AI processing."

**[VISUAL: Critical architecture warning]**

```dockerfile
# Copy handler
COPY handler.py .

CMD ["python", "-u", "handler.py"]
```

**[VISUAL: Big red warning sign]**

**Script:**
"CRITICAL: When building, you MUST specify the platform as linux/amd64, even on Mac M1/M2. This was a major gotcha we discovered!"

---

## SECTION 7: Building and Pushing the Docker Image (12:00 - 13:30)

**[VISUAL: Terminal commands]**

**Script:**
"Time to build our Docker image. Here's the crucial command:"

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 \
  -t yourusername/multitalk:latest --push .
```

**[VISUAL: Highlight the --platform flag]**

**Script:**
"See that `--platform linux/amd64`? Without it, your container won't run on RunPod. Trust me, I learned this the hard way!"

**[VISUAL: Docker build in progress]**

"This will take a few minutes. While it builds, let me explain what's happening..."

**[VISUAL: DockerHub showing the pushed image]**

"Perfect! Our image is now on DockerHub, ready for RunPod to use."

---

## SECTION 8: Downloading Models to Network Volume (13:30 - 15:00)

**[VISUAL: Create download script]**

**Script:**
"Before we can process videos, we need to download the models to our network volume. I'll show you a clever way to do this using RunPod itself."

**[VISUAL: Show download script]**

```python
# download_models.py
import runpod
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

def download_handler(job):
    models = [
        "MeiGen-AI/MultiTalk",
        "Alibaba/Wan2.1"
    ]
    
    for model in models:
        print(f"Downloading {model}...")
        snapshot_download(
            repo_id=model,
            local_dir=f"/runpod-volume/models/{model}"
        )
    
    return {"status": "complete"}
```

**Script:**
"We'll run this as a one-time job on RunPod to download all models directly to the network volume."

---

## SECTION 9: Creating the RunPod Endpoint (15:00 - 16:30)

**[VISUAL: RunPod dashboard - Serverless section]**

**Script:**
"Now for the moment of truth - creating our endpoint!"

**[VISUAL: Click "New Endpoint"]**

"In RunPod, go to Serverless and click 'New Endpoint'."

**[VISUAL: Fill in the configuration]**

"Configure it as follows:
- Name: MultiTalk-Serverless
- Container Image: yourusername/multitalk:latest
- GPU: Select 'RTX 4090' (24GB VRAM)
- Workers: Min 0, Max 3
- Idle Timeout: 5 seconds
- Volume: Select our 'multitalk-models' volume
- Mount Path: /runpod-volume"

**[VISUAL: Advanced settings]**

"In advanced settings, make sure to set environment variables if needed."

**[VISUAL: Click deploy]**

"Click 'Deploy' and RunPod will create your endpoint!"

---

## SECTION 10: Testing Your Deployment (16:30 - 18:00)

**[VISUAL: Python script for testing]**

**Script:**
"Let's test our deployment! Create a test script:"

```python
import runpod
import base64
import numpy as np

runpod.api_key = "your-api-key"
endpoint = runpod.Endpoint("your-endpoint-id")

# Create test audio
audio = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 440 * np.linspace(0, 3, 48000))
audio_b64 = base64.b64encode(audio.astype(np.int16).tobytes()).decode()

# Send request
job = endpoint.run({
    "action": "generate",
    "audio": audio_b64,
    "duration": 3.0
})
```

**[VISUAL: Show the script running]**

"Run the script and watch the magic happen!"

**[VISUAL: RunPod dashboard showing job in progress]**

"You can monitor the job in the RunPod dashboard. First time will be slow due to cold start."

**[VISUAL: Generated video playing]**

"And there it is! Our AI-generated video from just audio input!"

---

## SECTION 11: Troubleshooting Common Issues (18:00 - 19:00)

**[VISUAL: Error messages and solutions]**

**Script:**
"Let me save you some headaches with common issues I encountered:"

**[VISUAL: "exec format error"]**

"1. 'Exec format error' - You forgot `--platform linux/amd64` when building Docker."

**[VISUAL: Jobs stuck in queue]**

"2. Jobs stuck in queue - Check your GPU selection matches available GPUs."

**[VISUAL: Model not found errors]**

"3. Model loading fails - Ensure volume is mounted at `/runpod-volume`."

**[VISUAL: Tips checklist]**

"Pro tips:
- Always test with health checks first
- Monitor logs in RunPod dashboard
- Start with minimal functionality, then expand"

---

## SECTION 12: Cost Analysis & Optimization (19:00 - 19:45)

**[VISUAL: Cost breakdown graphic]**

**Script:**
"Let's talk money. Here's what this actually costs:"

**[VISUAL: Animated cost calculator]**

"- Network Volume: $0.10/GB/month = $10/month for 100GB
- Processing: $0.00024/second on RTX 4090
- Typical 5-second video generation = $0.0012
- 1000 videos = $1.20"

**[VISUAL: Comparison with traditional hosting]**

"Compare that to traditional GPU hosting at $500+/month!"

**Script:**
"To optimize costs:
- Set idle timeout to 5 seconds
- Use smaller GPU for testing
- Batch process when possible"
