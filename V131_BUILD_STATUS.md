# V131 Build Status & Next Steps

## Current Situation

1. **V130 Issue**: Has NumPy 2.3 instead of 1.26.4, causing Numba compatibility errors
2. **V131 Created**: Fixed Dockerfile using PyTorch 2.1.0 base image to avoid NumPy 2.x
3. **V131 Build Failed**: GitHub Actions build failed (unknown reason)
4. **Endpoint Status**: Currently using non-existent V131 image, causing "manifest not found" errors

## What We Know Works

- V130 builds successfully via GitHub Actions
- GitHub Actions workflow is properly authenticated to Docker Hub
- The workflow itself is correct (worked for V130-final)

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Trigger V131 Build Manually**:
   ```
   Go to: https://github.com/berrylands/meigen-multitalk-runpod-serverless/actions
   Click "Build and Push MultiTalk"
   Run workflow with version: v131
   ```

2. **Monitor Build**:
   - Watch for any errors in the build process
   - If it fails, check the logs to understand why

3. **Alternative: Local Build & Push**:
   ```bash
   cd runpod-multitalk
   docker build -f Dockerfile.v131 -t berrylands/multitalk-runpod:v131 .
   docker push berrylands/multitalk-runpod:v131
   ```

## V131 Key Changes

- Base image: `pytorch/pytorch:2.1.0-cuda11.8-cudnn8-runtime` (not 2.4.0)
- Explicit NumPy uninstall/reinstall to 1.26.4
- Numba 0.59.1 installation
- Multiple NumPy version checks

## Template Status

- Template ID: joospbpdol
- Currently set to: berrylands/multitalk-runpod:v130 (reverted from v131)
- Ready to update once V131 is built

## Test Jobs Submitted

1. aeda20fd-bdaa-4a46-92fb-5d4d8a26e7df-e1 - Failed (V131 image not found)
2. b765c147-5d9b-4d15-9e1e-6b91ef78c2cd-e2 - Failed (V131 image not found)

Once V131 is successfully built and pushed, update the template and test again.
