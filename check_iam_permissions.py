üîç IAM Permission Check

For S3 access to work, the IAM user needs these permissions:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::760572149-framepack",
                "arn:aws:s3:::760572149-framepack/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

Common issues:
1. ‚ùå IAM user only has GetObject but not ListBucket permission
2. ‚ùå IAM policy restricts access by IP address (RunPod IPs not whitelisted)
3. ‚ùå IAM policy has condition that restricts access
4. ‚ùå Wrong AWS Access Key ID or Secret in RunPod

To test if it's a permission issue:
1. Try creating a new IAM user with full S3 access
2. Update RunPod secrets with the new credentials
3. Test again

Or check your current IAM policy for any conditions like:
- IpAddress restrictions
- MFA requirements  
- Time-based restrictions
