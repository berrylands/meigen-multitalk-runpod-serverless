# Final Deployment Guide - MultiTalk with S3 + PyTorch

## üöÄ Complete Solution Ready!

### Docker Image
**`berrylands/multitalk-pytorch:latest`** (6.63GB)

This image includes:
- ‚úÖ PyTorch 2.4.1 with CUDA support
- ‚úÖ Transformers, librosa, and all ML dependencies
- ‚úÖ S3 integration (boto3)
- ‚úÖ FFmpeg for audio/video processing
- ‚úÖ Fixed S3 handler for empty endpoint URLs
- ‚úÖ Complete MultiTalk handler

### Update RunPod Endpoint

1. Go to https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless
2. Click on endpoint `kkx3cfy484jszl`
3. Update Docker image to: `berrylands/multitalk-pytorch:latest`
4. Save changes

The endpoint will restart with full functionality.

### S3 Usage Guide

#### For Input Files
Use just the filename, not the full S3 URL:
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT
"audio": "1.wav"           # For files in bucket root
"audio": "folder/file.wav" # For files in subdirectories

# ‚ùå WRONG
"audio": "s3://760572149-framepack/1.wav"
```

#### For Output Files
Specify S3 output:
```python
{
    "action": "generate",
    "audio": "1.wav",
    "output_format": "s3",
    "s3_output_key": "outputs/my-video.mp4"
}
```

### Complete Working Example

```python
import runpod
runpod.api_key = "your-api-key"
endpoint = runpod.Endpoint("kkx3cfy484jszl")

# Generate video from S3 audio
job = endpoint.run({
    "action": "generate",
    "audio": "1.wav",              # S3 file
    "duration": 5.0,               # Video duration
    "width": 480,                  # Video width
    "height": 480,                 # Video height
    "fps": 30,                     # Frames per second
    "output_format": "s3",         # Save to S3
    "s3_output_key": "outputs/result.mp4"
})

# Wait for result
result = job.output()
print(f"Video saved to: {result['video']}")
```

### What's Different Now?

1. **Real Video Generation**: With PyTorch installed, you'll get actual MultiTalk video generation instead of dummy output
2. **GPU Acceleration**: If RunPod provides GPU, inference will be much faster
3. **All Models Available**: Wav2Vec2, Wan2.1, and other models will load properly

### Testing

After updating to the new image:
```bash
python test_final_s3.py
```

This will verify:
- S3 file access
- Model loading
- Real video generation
- S3 output

### Troubleshooting

If you still see "Test implementation" in the output:
1. Make sure RunPod updated to the new image
2. Check worker logs for any model loading errors
3. Verify GPU is available (optional but recommended)

### Performance Notes

- First run will be slower (model loading)
- Subsequent runs will be faster (models cached)
- GPU recommended for reasonable performance
- Video generation time depends on duration and resolution

### Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
1. No "PyTorch not available" errors
2. No "Test implementation" messages
3. Real video files generated
4. Processing time is reasonable (not instant dummy output)
