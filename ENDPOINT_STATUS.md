# RunPod Endpoint Status Report

## Current Situation

Your endpoint `pdz7evo425qwmz` is created but jobs are stuck in queue.

### Identified Issues:

1. **GPU Mismatch**: 
   - Configured: `AMPERE_48,ADA_48_PRO` (48GB GPUs like A40, A6000)
   - Intended: RTX 4090 (24GB)
   - These GPUs might not be available, causing queue issues

2. **Very Short Idle Timeout**: 
   - Current: 5 seconds
   - Recommended: 60+ seconds for development

3. **Template Configuration**:
   - Using template ID: `x7tcaxtizz`
   - Need to verify Docker image in template

## Immediate Actions Needed:

### Option 1: Fix Current Endpoint (via RunPod Dashboard)

1. Go to: https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless
2. Click on "dramatic_aqua_ptarmigan -fb"
3. Click "Edit" or settings icon
4. Change:
   - **GPU Type**: Select "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090" 
   - **Idle Timeout**: Set to 60 seconds
   - **Container Image**: Verify it's `berrylands/multitalk-test:latest`
5. Save changes

### Option 2: Create New Endpoint (Recommended)

Since the current endpoint might have template issues, create a fresh one:

1. Go to: https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless
2. Delete the current endpoint (optional)
3. Click "+ New Endpoint"
4. **IMPORTANT**: Don't select any template, click "Continue" to skip
5. Configure:
   - Name: `multitalk-test-v2`
   - Container Image: `berrylands/multitalk-test:latest`
   - GPU: `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090`
   - Min Workers: 0
   - Max Workers: 1
   - Idle Timeout: 60
   - Network Volume: `meigen-multitalk` â†’ `/runpod-volume`
   - Environment Variables:
     - `MODEL_PATH` = `/runpod-volume/models`

## Testing Your Fixed/New Endpoint

Once you have a working endpoint, test it:

```bash
python test_async.py
```

Or use the endpoint ID directly:

```python
ENDPOINT_ID = "your-new-endpoint-id"
```

## Why Jobs Are Stuck

Jobs get stuck in queue when:
- No GPU of the requested type is available
- Docker image can't be pulled
- Worker fails to start due to configuration issues
- Network volume mounting fails

## Next Steps

1. Fix the endpoint configuration (GPU type is critical)
2. Test with the simple handler
3. Once working, we'll deploy the full MultiTalk image

Let me know which option you choose and the new endpoint ID!
