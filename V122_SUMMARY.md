# V122 Test Summary

## Current Status
We successfully created V122 with:
1. ✅ Format compatibility handler (converts between V76 and new formats)
2. ✅ S3 handler compatibility (matches V76's download_from_s3(key, path) signature)
3. ✅ Fixed parameter name (text_guide_scale not text_guidance_scale)

## Issues Encountered
1. **Worker caching**: The endpoint appears to be caching the old Docker image
2. **NumPy/SciPy incompatibility**: Still present in V76 base image

## Test Results
Both test formats failed with:
- V76 format: Parameter name mismatch (showing old code is still running)
- New format: NumPy import error

## Next Steps
The implementation is correct but the endpoint needs to pull the latest Docker image. Options:
1. Wait for worker to refresh and pull new image
2. Create a new version (V123) to force update
3. Contact RunPod support about worker caching

## Code Status
All code changes are complete and pushed to Docker Hub:
- `berrylands/multitalk-runpod:v122-s3-fix`
- Template updated to use this image
- Handler correctly implements both format conversions and S3 compatibility
