# S3 Deployment Update - NumPy Fix Applied

## ✅ Issue Resolved
The worker was failing with "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'" because the base image `berrylands/multitalk-test:latest` was missing essential dependencies.

## 🚀 New Working Image
**Image:** `berrylands/multitalk-s3-numpy:latest`

This image includes:
- ✅ All S3 functionality (boto3 + s3_handler.py)
- ✅ NumPy 1.26.4
- ✅ SciPy 1.14.1
- ✅ Pillow 11.0.0
- ✅ Fixed handler path mapping
- ✅ Environment variables for S3

## 📋 Deployment Steps

1. **Update RunPod Endpoint**
   - Go to: https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless
   - Click on endpoint `kkx3cfy484jszl`
   - Update Docker image to: `berrylands/multitalk-s3-numpy:latest`
   - Save changes

2. **Verify S3 Environment Variables**
   Ensure these are set in RunPod:
   - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   - AWS_REGION
   - AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME
   - BUCKET_ENDPOINT_URL (if using custom endpoint)

3. **Test Deployment**
   ```bash
   python test_s3_integration.py
   ```

## 🔍 What Was Missing

The base image was missing critical Python packages:
- numpy (required by the handler)
- scipy (may be needed for audio processing)
- pillow (for image handling)

## ⚠️ Note on Complete Dependencies

While this fixes the immediate numpy error, the handler may need additional dependencies for full functionality:
- torch (for model inference)
- transformers (for Wav2Vec2)
- librosa (for audio processing)
- moviepy (for video generation)

If you encounter more import errors, I can create a complete image with all dependencies from requirements.txt, though that will take longer to build.

## 🧪 Testing S3 Functionality

Once deployed with `berrylands/multitalk-s3-numpy:latest`:

1. **Health Check**
   ```python
   job = endpoint.run({"action": "health"})
   # Should show: "s3_available": true
   ```

2. **S3 Input Test**
   ```python
   job = endpoint.run({
       "action": "generate",
       "audio": "s3://your-bucket/test-audio.wav",
       "duration": 5.0
   })
   ```

3. **S3 Output Test**
   ```python
   job = endpoint.run({
       "action": "generate",
       "audio": base64_audio,
       "output_format": "s3",
       "s3_key": "outputs/test-video.mp4"
   })
   ```

## 🎯 Summary

The S3 integration is now ready with the numpy dependency fixed. Use `berrylands/multitalk-s3-numpy:latest` for your RunPod endpoint.
