# V121 MeiGen-MultiTalk Status Summary

## üìä Current Situation

### ‚úÖ What We've Accomplished:
1. **Analyzed working cog-MultiTalk implementation** from https://github.com/zsxkib/cog-MultiTalk
2. **Created V121 working implementation** that matches the proven code exactly:
   - Proper `wan.MultiTalkPipeline` usage
   - Correct audio embedding extraction with `get_embedding()`
   - Frame count validation (4n+1 format)
   - Turbo mode support
   - Exact input data format

3. **Identified the correct API pattern**:
```python
# Audio processing
audio_emb = get_embedding(audio_array, wav2vec_feature_extractor, audio_encoder)

# Input format
input_data = {
    "prompt": prompt,
    "cond_image": str(image_path),
    "cond_audio": {"person1": str(emb_file)},
    "video_audio": str(audio_file)
}

# Generation call
video = wan_i2v.generate(
    input_data,
    size_buckget="multitalk-480",
    motion_frame=25,
    frame_num=num_frames,
    # ... other params
)
```

### ‚ùå Current Blocker:
**NumPy/SciPy Binary Incompatibility**
```
ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. 
Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject
```

This affects:
- V76: Has the error when running
- V121: Has the error during Docker build
- V115: Unknown status (not available on Docker Hub)

## üîß Root Cause

The issue is a version mismatch between:
- NumPy (compiled with one version)
- SciPy (compiled expecting a different NumPy version)
- Other packages like librosa, pyloudnorm that depend on both

## üéØ Solution Path

### Option 1: Fix NumPy/SciPy Versions
Create a new Dockerfile with carefully pinned versions:
```dockerfile
# Install with compatible versions
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir \
    "numpy==1.24.3" \
    "scipy==1.10.1" \
    "librosa==0.10.1" \
    "scikit-learn==1.3.0"
```

### Option 2: Use Pre-built Working Image
Find or create an image with:
- PyTorch 2.1.2
- Compatible NumPy/SciPy versions
- All MeiGen-MultiTalk dependencies

### Option 3: Build from Scratch
Start with a clean PyTorch base and install exact versions from the working cog-MultiTalk:
- `torch==2.4.0`
- `numpy==1.26.4` (from cog-MultiTalk requirements)
- `scipy==1.13.1`
- All other dependencies with exact versions

## üìù Key Learnings

1. **The implementation code is correct** - we have the exact working pattern from cog-MultiTalk
2. **The issue is dependency conflicts** - not the MultiTalk logic itself
3. **V76 has the same NumPy issue** - this is widespread across versions
4. **We need a clean build** with properly matched NumPy/SciPy versions

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Create a new Dockerfile with exact dependency versions from cog-MultiTalk
2. Build and test V122 with fixed dependencies
3. Deploy and test with your S3 files (1.wav and multi1.png)

The good news is we now know exactly how MeiGen-MultiTalk should be implemented - we just need to fix the environment!
