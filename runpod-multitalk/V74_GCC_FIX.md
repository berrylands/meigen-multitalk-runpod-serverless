# MultiTalk V74 - GCC Installation Fix

## 🔧 Problem Identified

V73 logs showed:
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'gcc'
```

The environment variable approach (`ENV CC=gcc`) was insufficient because gcc wasn't actually installed in the container.

## 🎯 V74 Solution

### Key Changes
1. **Actually installs gcc**: `apt-get install -y build-essential`
2. **Includes full build toolchain**: gcc, g++, make
3. **Rebuilds xformers**: Force reinstall to match PyTorch version
4. **Maintains environment variables**: For good measure

### Dockerfile Changes
```dockerfile
# Install build-essential which includes gcc, g++, make
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

## 📊 Expected Results

V74 should:
- ✅ Have gcc available when Triton needs it
- ✅ Successfully compile Triton kernels at runtime
- ✅ Execute official MultiTalk script without compilation errors
- ✅ Generate talking head videos successfully

## 🚀 Deployment

```bash
cd runpod-multitalk
./scripts/build_v74.sh berrylands
```

**Docker Image**: `berrylands/multitalk-v74:gcc-install`

## 📈 Progress Timeline

| Version | Issue | Fix Attempted | Result |
|---------|-------|---------------|---------|
| V72 | Missing C compiler | None | ❌ RuntimeError |
| V73 | gcc not found | ENV variables only | ❌ FileNotFoundError |
| **V74** | gcc binary missing | **Actually install gcc** | 🎯 Should work |

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue progression:
1. V72: Triton tried to compile kernels but no compiler was set
2. V73: We set CC=gcc but gcc binary wasn't in the container
3. V74: Actually install gcc so the binary exists

This is a common issue with PyTorch containers - they often don't include build tools to keep size down, but some operations (like Triton) need them at runtime.

## 🧪 Test Command

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.runpod.ai/v2/YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID/runsync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {}}'
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

Monitor logs for:
1. No "No such file or directory: 'gcc'" errors
2. Successful Triton kernel compilation
3. Official generate_multitalk.py script completes
4. Video file generated and uploaded to S3
