# MultiTalk Implementation Notes

## Current Status

The current RunPod implementation is using placeholder code that draws simple animations instead of using the actual MeiGen-AI MultiTalk model. This is why you're seeing static images with black ovals for mouths instead of realistic facial animations.

## What's Missing

1. **Actual MultiTalk Model Integration**
   - The real implementation requires using `generate_multitalk.py` from the official MeiGen-AI/MultiTalk repository
   - Our code has TODOs and placeholders instead of actual model inference

2. **Proper Model Loading**
   - MultiTalk weights need to be linked/integrated with Wan2.1 model
   - The GGUF format of Wan2.1 needs special loading (not implemented)

3. **Audio-Visual Synchronization**
   - Real MultiTalk uses Label Rotary Position Embedding (L-RoPE) for audio-visual alignment
   - Current code just uses audio amplitude for mouth movement

## How Real MultiTalk Works

1. **Audio Processing**: Uses Wav2Vec2 to extract audio features
2. **Video Generation**: Uses Wan2.1 diffusion model conditioned on:
   - Audio features
   - Reference image
   - Text prompt
   - MultiTalk weights for lip-sync
3. **Output**: Generates realistic facial movements, not just mouth animations

## To Implement Real MultiTalk

### Option 1: Integrate Official Code
```python
# Clone official repository
git clone https://github.com/MeiGen-AI/MultiTalk.git

# Copy core files to our project
cp MultiTalk/generate_multitalk.py runpod-multitalk/src/
cp -r MultiTalk/scripts runpod-multitalk/src/
cp -r MultiTalk/trainer runpod-multitalk/src/
```

### Option 2: Use ComfyUI Integration
There's a ComfyUI workflow for MultiTalk that might be easier to integrate:

### Option 3: Minimal Implementation
At minimum, we need:
1. Proper GGUF loader for Wan2.1
2. Integration of MultiTalk safetensors with the diffusion pipeline
3. Correct audio feature extraction and conditioning

## Why Current Implementation Fails

The current code in `real_multitalk_inference.py` is essentially:
```python
# What we have (simplified)
def generate_video(audio, image):
    amplitude = calculate_audio_amplitude(audio)
    draw_black_oval_on_mouth(image, size=amplitude)
    return video

# What we need
def generate_video(audio, image):
    audio_features = wav2vec2.encode(audio)
    video_latents = wan21_model.generate(
        image=image,
        audio_features=audio_features,
        multitalk_weights=multitalk_model
    )
    return decode_latents_to_video(video_latents)
```

## Recommendations

1. **Short-term**: Acknowledge that current implementation is a placeholder
2. **Medium-term**: Integrate the official MultiTalk code
3. **Long-term**: Optimize for RunPod serverless (caching, quantization, etc.)

The models are downloaded correctly, but the inference code needs to be replaced with the actual MultiTalk implementation from the official repository.
